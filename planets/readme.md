Planetary Vexations

Dec 2024

Generative music piece based on Erik Satie's piano work Vexations. The piano composition is based on real-time positions of the planets, with electronic intrusions based on planetary relations, taking it into Sun Ra territory. 

I became obsessed with Satie's Vexations after composer Stephen Montague introduced my students and me to it around 2018. When I decided to re-create an old world of mine that used the planets to play piano, it provided the perfect framework. I enjoyed writing 'Vexation logic' and 'Planetary Calculator class'

My original piece (c.2002) used real-time data on planetary positions accessed over the internet. For this, I realized that these, like a lot of astronomical phenomena, could be calculated for any given time, so I could eliminate any additional network operations. The trade-off is that thecalculations are simplified and don't account for orbital eccentricity, inclinations, and equinoxes. But by introducing the electronic interventions, these take into account interactions between planets. 

I wanted a good piano sound, so I used samples – specifically Salamander. It uses fewer files, the samples are recorded in minor thirds to save space while maintaining quality. For the electronic part, I use standard tone.js library, but with echo & effects. I experimented with rhythmic elements and chaos factors, and settled on a filtered notes layer, with multiple grains per event for maximum texture. 

For installation, this uses surround sound to place planets and events in their spatial position relative to the installation space. Created Dec 2024.
